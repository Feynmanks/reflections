When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks is a operation between repositories on GitHub.
clone is a operation between repository on GitHub and local repository.
branches is an alias for commit. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It could let you know the state of the remote when you are off line, and could compare the master and origin/master.
